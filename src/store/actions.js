  /**
   * Actions
   *
   * When we need to fech some data from an api we would create an action for it.
   * Vuex automatically passes the - CONTEXT object - as the first parameter to all actions
   * The context object exposes the same set of methods and properties as the store object
   *
   * This means that we can use :
   *  -> context.commit to commit an mutation
   *  -> context.state to access the state, and so on (assim por diante)
   *
   * Actions are also responsible for the logic of when mutations shold be fired (disparada)
   *
   * Ex: when a user adds a product to the cart we would call an action
   *
   *  actions: { // = methods
   */
